# R1zz P0w3r-Up S1mul4t0r - Pr0j3ct 1mpl3m3nt4t10n Pl4n 🚀

## 1. Pr0j3ct 0v3rv13w 🔍

The R1zz P0w3r-Up S1mul4t0r is a vaporwave-style mobile web app that allows users to tap a button to increase their "Rizz" (charisma) level. With each tap, users receive a "Rizz Quote" from a predefined set and see their stats increase by a fixed amount.

### K3y R3qu1r3m3nts fr0m PRD: 📋
- Mobile-first game that users can interact with in under 1 minute
- Use humor, AI, and pop culture to retain attention
- Optimize for virality with screenshot/share flows
- Vaporwave aesthetic with engaging animations

### K3y D3c1s10ns B4s3d 0n F33db4ck: 🧠
- User progress will be stored locally using localStorage
- Quotes will come from a predefined set stored locally (no API costs)
- Special events will occur at fixed intervals every 10 taps
- Hybrid vaporwave aesthetic with clean base design and glitchy effects during special events
- No sound effects or background music
- All stats increase by a fixed amount with each tap
- No custom screenshot functionality (device will handle it natively)
- Implement basic analytics with Google Analytics
