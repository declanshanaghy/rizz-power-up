# ⚡ Rizz Power-Up Simulator – Product Requirements Document

## 🧠 Overview

**Rizz Power-Up Simulator** is a vaporwave-style mobile web app that allows users to tap a button to increase their "Rizz" (charisma) level. With each tap, users receive an AI-generated "Rizz Quote" and see their stats (e.g., Swagger, Vibe, Cringe Resistance) increase. The app offers instant feedback, occasional special events, and social sharing to drive engagement.

---

## 🎯 Goals

- Deliver a meme-forward, mobile-first game that users can interact with in under 1 minute.
- Use humor, AI, and pop culture to retain attention.
- Optimize for virality with screenshot/share flows.
